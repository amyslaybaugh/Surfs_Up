# Surfs_Up

## Overview of the statistical analysis:
The purpose of this analysis is to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round. Temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu was analyzed using SQLite, SQLAlchemy and Jupiter NotebooK.

## Results:
*  There is an 8 degree difference in the average minimum temperatures of June and December, 56 and 64 degrees respectively.
*  The average temperature in June is 74.9 degrees, in December it is 71 degrees.
*  The maximum average temperature in June is 85 degrees, in December it is 83 degrees.

## Summary:
As there is little change in temperature between June and December, on the basis of temperature alone the business should be sustainable year round.  Additional queries into the precipitation data, specifically summary statistics for both June and December, would be required to assure that weather would not be a factor in the success of a year round business.
